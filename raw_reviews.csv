Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by a proprietary anaerobic fermentation method in which the coffee fruit is first sterilized, then fermented anaerobically in the whole fruit with added microorganisms for 36 hours. After this fermentation in the whole fruit, the coffee is subjected to thermal shock (first a high temperature to swell the beans and allow the unique flavors and aromas from the initial anaerobic yeast fermentation to penetrate the seeds, then a cold temperature to constrict the beans and lock in those flavors and aromas). Finally, the whole cherries are carefully dried by machine until the beans reach 10.5% internal humidity. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.
Bottom Line
An unabashed fruit bomb of a coffee: produced entirely from the rare Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed anaerobically, netting an intense, flavor-saturated, richly aromatic profile with ballast from bittersweet floral notes.

Very sweet, floral, tropical fruit-toned. Lychee, green grape, pomegranate, baking chocolate, watermelon candy in aroma and cup. Tartly bittersweet in structure, with a delicate, silky mouthfeel. Crisply chocolaty in finish with a continued suggestion of watermelon candy.
Notes
Produced by brothers Nestor and Adrian Lasso of Finca El Diviso entirely of the Sidra variety of Arabica, and processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Sidra is an Ethiopian variety of coffee that at some unknown point in its history was selected and brought to Ecuador, then to nearby Colombia. Peach Coffee Roasters is an Atlanta-area specialty roaster. Visit www.peachcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A pleasantly eccentric cup, with tropical fruit (especially lychee), candyish watermelon, and crisp, dry chocolate jostling for attention.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 25 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2023. Produced by Wilton Benitez of Granja Paraiso 92, entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobic thermal shock method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation. SÖT Coffee Roaster, based in Osaka, Japan, is a self-described Swedish-style roaster with an “aggressively light” roasting style. For more information, visit www.sotcoffee.com.
Bottom Line
A focused, intensely perfumed, experimentally processed Colombia Geisha that’s, at turns, chocolaty, musky, tropical and sweetly herbaceous.

Deep-toned, sweetly fermenty. Dark chocolate, papaya, fresh-cut fir, grappa, agave syrup in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with brisk acidity; lightly satiny mouthfeel. Richly sweet, gently drying in the finish.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. MT49 Cafe is a specialty coffee shop and bakery in Taichung City, Taiwan. Visit https://www.facebook.com/MT49cafe/ for more information.
Bottom Line
A pleasantly wood-framed, intentionally fermenty and fruit-toned Ethiopia cup.

Blind Assessment
A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Complex, nuanced, multi-layered. Lilac, dark chocolate, lemon verbena, dried apricot, Bourbon barrel. Sweetly tart with juicy-bright acidity; lightly syrupy, very refreshing mouthfeel. Invitingly rich finish with suggestions of Bourbon barrel integrated with classic Ethiopia notes of dried stone fruit and sweet herbs.
Notes
Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used is a washed-process Ethiopia Yirgacheffe aged in Bourbon whiskey barrels. Regent Coffee was established in 2017 in Glendale, California. With more than 10 years of roasting experience, Regent strives to deliver coffee with care and purpose. Visit regentcoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line
An addictively compelling barrel-aged Yirgacheffe cold brew, aromatically reminiscent of fine Bourbon but all classic Ethiopia coffee on the palate — a very pretty sipper.

Notes
Produced by Edwin Noreña of Finca Campo Hermoso, entirely of the Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by the carbonic maceration method, as follows: The whole fruit is co-fermented with aji chili must in oxygen-free containers for 96 hours. The fruit is then semi-washed (some of the fruit flesh is left on the bean), then returned to the carbonic fermentation tanks and re-infused with fresh aji chili must for an additional 48 hours. After the secondary carbonic fermentation, the coffee is dried on raised beds for 22 days and then set in a relative humidity-controlled warehouse for a final eight days of repose. Barrington Coffee is an artisan roaster dedicated to elite coffees, fresh delivery, and roasting that foregrounds the coffee and not the roast. Visit www.barringtoncoffee.com or call 800-528-0998 for more information.
Bottom Line
A wild ride of a coffee with distinct notes of peppercorn (the coffee was co-fermented with aji chili) that’s also a fruity and fun carbonic-macerated cup.

The resonant finish centers around black currant and hop flowers in the short, cocoa nib and amber in the long.

This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of “Cause Coffees” for Coffee Review’s March 2021 report. Roasters of these coffees contribute a portion of proceeds to non-profit organizations doing work to improve the lives of others, locally or globally. Processed by the meticulous Kenya variation on the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Wild Goose emphasizes its relationship-driven green coffee sourcing, and for every pound of coffee sold it purchases ten pounds of food for a local food bank, with over 750,000 pounds donated to date.

Very fruit-centric, spicily floral. Watermelon candy, star jasmine, agave syrup, pistachio butter, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Brightly sweet-tart with energetic acidity; very full, viscous mouthfeel. Resonant, fruit-focused finish with pistachio undertones.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Drink Coffee Do Stuff operates a roastery in Truckee, California and a coffee shop in nearby Incline Village, Nevada. Visit www.drinkcoffeedostuff.com for more information.

A confident, unapologetic fruit bomb of a coffee with spicy floral complication.

Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was grown in Kona and processed by the natural method (beans are dried in the whole fruit). Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years. In 2017 they introduced several distinguished new tree varieties to their 4.7 acre farm. Visit konafarmdirect.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A cleanly fruit-forward Bourbon Pointu cup from Kona supported by rich nut, sweet herb, and aromatic wood notes.

Exuberant yet coherent anaerobic. Butterscotch, blueberry, cocoa, lilac, candycap mushroom in aroma and cup. Sweet, tart and savory impulses balance in a richly expressive structure. Plush, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Fruit notes consolidate in a long though quiet finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of Finca El Paraíso entirely of the rare Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by a complexly detailed version of the double-anaerobic method (sealed-tank fermentation of the whole fruit with the addition of brewer’s yeast, removal of skin and pulp, and a second fermentation of the beans shut in the tank with the removed skin and pulp). Additional processing nuance includes a thermal shock wash (soaking the whole fruit in hot water for 30 seconds, then cold water for 30 seconds) to reduce astringency. Reprise Coffee is a quality-oriented small-batch roaster and café located in Lake Forest, Illinois, north of Chicago. Visit reprisecoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A fruit-forward but balanced, tangy-rich rendition of the anaerobic style.

Richly tropical, sweetly herbaceous. Pineapple, passionfruit, lemon verbena, ginger blossom, toffee in aroma and cup. Sparkling acidity; plush, silky mouthfeel. Long, lingering harmonious finish.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 13 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2023. Produced by Wilton Benitez of Granja Paraiso 92, entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by the thermal shock method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation.Big Shoulders Coffee is a Chicago artisan roaster that emphasizes a fresh-roasted, no-nonsense approach to fine coffee. Visit www.bigshoulderscoffee.com or call 312-846-1439 for more information.
Bottom Line
Tropical aromatherapy! This experimentally processed Geisha is characterized by tropical fruit and herb notes, rich-toned and uniquely composed, with a complex, lyrically sweet cup.

Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of Finca El Paraíso entirely of the Java variety of Arabica, and processed by a complex double-anaerobic washed method, in which the coffee fruit is first sterilized, then fermented in the whole fruit in a bio-reactor and inoculated with Saccromyces cervesiae var. Diastaticus. (Strains from this yeast variety are commonly used in producing Saison style beers.) After this fermentation in the whole fruit, the coffee is pulped and subjected to a second fermentation phase, after which the beans are sealed through the impact of hot and cold water before drying by machine for 46 hours at 38C (100F). Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Produced by 200 widows with support and training from husband-wife team Kardon and Yulinda, from trees of the Andungsari, LiniS795 and Sigararutang varieties of Arabica. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Speckled Ax is a roaster based in Portland, Maine, specializing in high-quality certified organic and small-lot coffees. The company roasts in a vintage wood-fired Petroncini roaster with the goal of highlighting each coffee’s best attributes. Visit www.speckledax.com for more information.

Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report.

Consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

Notes
Burundi is a small, landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Most coffee is grown in the mountains of the north, bordering Rwanda. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi coffee has an excellent reputation, though it is better known in Europe than in the United States. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Mystic Monk Coffee is a small-batch roaster associated with a Carmelite monastery located in the Rocky Mountains of northern Wyoming. The monks emphasize an artisan approach to roasting and a commitment to quality. Visit www.mysticmonkcoffee.com or call 877-751-6377 for more information.

Produced by Diego Samuel Bermudez Tapia of El Paraiso Farm from trees of the Castillo, Colombia and Caturra varieties of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobic method: Whole fruit is fermented in hermetically sealed tanks for 24 hours before the skins are removed. The fruit flesh or mucilage is left on the bean for another 36-hour sealed-tank fermentation. Finally, the coffee is dried on raised beds with the mucilage still on the bean, as in the honey method.

Deeply rich, sweetly spice-toned. Cinnamon, nutmeg, pear, honey, lavender in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with lively, juicy acidity; silky, buoyant mouthfeel. The finish is spice-toned and rich.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 29 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing them. Peach Coffee Roasters is an Atlanta, Georgia-based specialty roaster. Visit peachcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A spice-driven coffee redolent of winter baking. A uniquely composed and compelling experimentally processed Costa Rica cup.

Notes
Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing it. This coffee was imported by Genuine Origin, a specialty-focused coffee importer based in Irvington, New York. Collage Coffee is a micro-roastery featuring specialty coffee and house brewed kombucha. Colläge works with local artists to promote fine arts in its region, and loves serving its community. This coffee is available for purchase at the Collage store and cafe, 221 South Broad Street, Grove City, Pennsylvania.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Complex, richly tart, sweetly herbaceous. Watermelon candy, sassafras, star jasmine, dark chocolate, hint of eucalyptus in aroma and small cup. Viscous, syrupy mouthfeel; crisp, sweetly herbal finish. In cappuccino format, balanced, bright, deep, juicy and chocolaty.
Notes
Produced by smallholding farmers around Durato Bombe Farm under the direction of Asefa and Mulugeta Dukamo largely from local landrace varieties of Arabica, and processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Barrington Coffee is an artisan roaster dedicated to elite coffees, fresh delivery and roasting that foregrounds the coffee and not the roast. Visit www.barringtoncoffee.com or call 800-528-0998 for more information.
Bottom Line
This is a vertical coffee, from a launchpad of dark chocolate notes straight up through candy-like fruit and heady florals — call it a contemplative’s desert-island espresso.

Notes

Soaringly high-toned anaerobic, bright, complex, exhilarating. Raspberry, rose, violet, cardamom, passionfruit in aroma and cup. In structure, layered and intriguingly savory-bright. Silky in mouthfeel, nimble and lively on the palate. Flowers carry far into a deep, long finish.

The whole coffee fruit is sealed in drums for CO2 fermentation for 72 hours, after which the skin and pulp are removed from the beans. The skin and pulp are infused with Galaxy hops and recombined with the pulped beans in the carbonic fermentation tanks for another 96 hours before the beans are sun-dried on raised beds.

Evaluated at a steeping time of 6 minutes. This beverage is composed of coffee that has essentially been toasted but not roasted. Toasted grain, cocoa nib, hints of raw cashew and limelike citrus in aroma and cup. Sweet, woody/grainy structure with a hint of bitterness but no acidy sensation whatsoever. The mouthfeel is thin and tea-like but silky in texture. Grain and nut fade in the finish, though a woody sweetness lasts.
Notes
The Golden Ratio company aims at selling North America on a coffee produced by steeping plump bags of ground coffee that has essentially been toasted rather than roasted. Instructions accompanying these pouches suggest steeping the pouch 5 to 10 minutes to produce an 8-ounce beverage. We achieved what we considered optimal results (maximum aromatic interest) at around 6 minutes. The pouches also can be brewed at room temperature for a recommended 12 to 18 hours. For more information go to drinkgoldenratio.com.
Bottom Line
Those who want caffeine and the health benefits of coffee without perceived acidity may value and enjoy this subtle, herbal-tea-like beverage. Think cocoa puffs breakfast cereal without the sugar.

Notes
Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions.

Round, deeply fruit- and cocoa-toned. Blackberry jam, dark chocolate, praline, peach, a hint of myrrh. Deep, ringing sweetness in the structure without a hint of sugary overstatement. Smooth, mouth filling in the body; jammy cocoa-toned finish.
Notes
Produced by Jairo Ivan Lopez entirely of the Ethiopia-derived Java variety of Arabica, and processed by the natural carbonic method, which involves two fermentation phases in closed tanks injected with CO2. The first fermentation includes the whole coffee fruit, after which the skins and pulp are removed and the beans are fermented a second time with their skins and juice in the tank, after which they are washed and dried. Corvus particularly focuses on processing methods and selective harvesting, which results in small, seasonal micro-lots of uniquely sweet, vibrant and clean flavor profiles. For more information, visit www.corvuscoffee.com.
Bottom Line
A naturally and deeply sweet cup with gentle, rather Geisha-like floral and chocolaty complication.

Deeply sweet-savory. Blackberry, hop flowers, sandalwood, cocoa nib, a hint of lemon verbena in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with gentle, round acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Cocoa-toned sandalwood and blackberry notes characterize the resonant finish.
Notes
Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Cozy House Coffee is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee roaster and an SCA Authorized Trainer (AST). For more information, visit https://shop.cozyhousecoffee.com.
Bottom Line
A rich-toned natural Yirgacheffe cup with an invitingly savory-leaning structure and especially viscous mouthfeel.

Subtly powerful, harmoniously integrated, complete. Pineapple, nectarine, complex florals, cocoa nib, roasted pine nut in aroma and cup. Stunningly bright and expressive structure with very balanced acidity. Silky, buoyant mouthfeel. A deep, very long finish retains the grace and complexity of the cup through to the end.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Produced at Finca Sophia entirely from trees of the celebrated Geisha variety of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). This coffee was produced on the same farm under the same conditions as the lot that won the 2020 Best of Panama competition in the washed Geisha category (which famously sold at auction for a record-breaking $1,300.50 per pound) but it is not from the actual record-breaking lot.

An almost sugary-sweet, explosively herby and floral anaerobic. Rosemary, pink peppercorn, star jasmine, apricot yogurt, stone fruit in aroma and cup. Very sweet in structure with a tart edge; plush, supple mouthfeel. Yogurt and herb dominate the sweet finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilder Lazo of Finca Bella Alejandria entirely of the Gesha/Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by a version of the honey or semi-washed anaerobic method: after the removal of the fruit skin and pulp, but with the flesh or mucilage still on the bean, the coffee is fermented in hermetically sealed tanks for 200 hours. After fermentation, the coffee is sun-dried for 18 days mixed with mandarin orange peels before being rested for 25 days, then milled. Founded in Savannah Georgia, PERC Coffee Roasters has a total of three cafes in Savannah and Atlanta, as well as a coffee education and training center. Visit www.perccoffee.com for more information.

Notes
Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego farm and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing it.

Produced by smallholding farmers from the Ateng, Jember and Garundang varieties of Arabica. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and most admired of Sumatra growing regions.

Delicately sweet-tarty, fruity and lively. Baking chocolate, pomegranate, lime zest, cashew butter, oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with gently bright, winey acidity; crisp, silky mouthfeel. Baking chocolate and lime zest are central in the finish.
Notes
A blend of Typica, Red Bourbon and Red Catuai varieties of Arabica produced by Miranda Farms and JN Farms, processed using a proprietary method involving wine yeasts. The decaffeinated coffees were processed by Kona Decaf in Holualoa using pressurized carbon dioxide gas rather than chemical solvents to remove about 50% of the total caffeine, making this a “half-caf” coffee rather than a coffee decaffeinated using industrial methods that remove almost all of the caffeine. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
Bottom Line
A partially decaffeinated coffee of exemplary quality and distinction. Coffees of three traditional varieties are separately processed using Miguel Meza’s “champagne” method, blended, and subjected to partial decaffeination with no use of solvents. The result is a delightfully fruit-driven, chocolaty, low-caffeine cup.

Elegantly fruit-toned, tropical. Lychee, passionfruit, bergamot, star jasmine, lemon thyme in aroma and cup. Gently bright, sweet structure with high-toned acidity; very rich, buoyantly creamy mouthfeel. Long, lingering, integrated finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Papayo variety of Arabica. Processed by the kōji method, in which the coffee fruit is first sterilized and then fermented in a bio-reactor and inoculated with a selection of Japanese kōji (Aspergillus oryzae). This mold species breaks down starch into simple sugars and is commonly used in the production of soy sauce, miso, sake and shōchū. After whole-fruit fermentation, the coffee is pulped and subjected to a second fermentation phase. A bean-sealing process follows, carried out through impacts of hot and cold water, before the beans are dried by machine for 46 hours at 38C (100F). Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
Bottom Line
A uniquely composed cup from a rare variety of Arabica (Papayo), meticulously processed using complex methods by Wilton Benitez, widely recognized for his innovative processing experiments.

Bright yet deep-toned, sweet-tart-savory, intensely floral. Mango, dark chocolate, hop flowers, lilac, wild honey in aroma and cup. Richly bittersweet structure with juicy-bright acidity; viscous, nectar-like mouthfeel. Flavor-saturated, chocolaty finish.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 9 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Despite challenges ranging from unclear government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands to chronically unstable weather, the famed Kenya coffee auction system and its participating cooperatives continue to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. Processed by a particularly meticulous Kenya variation on the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.

A balanced yet supremely intricate Kenya cup that hits all the notes: tropical fruit, deep chocolate, both savory and sweet florals, and a distinct wild honey.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Temple Coffee is a quality-focused retail and wholesale specialty roaster active in Sacramento, California since 2005. Committed to sourcing, roasting and brewing the finest coffees, Temple features coffee from distinguished single estates and cooperatives around the world.

Notes
Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 808-327-9744 for more information.

Notes
Processed by the yellow honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the yellow honey variation, a thin layer of pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, more than with white honey, but less than is the case with red or black honey.

Notes
This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Tanzania is particularly associated with its peaberry grades. Chaos Coffee Co. is based in Bayboro, North Carolina and offers artisan-roasted specialty coffee.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 6 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a rare and famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety, although it closely resembles a variety long grown in Yemen called Ismaili. This Mocca was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list.

Notes
This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Perhaps arbitrarily, Tanzania is particularly associated with its peaberry grades. Pink Elephant Coffee, with a cafe in Park City, Utah and a roastery in nearby Heber City, crafts coffees for Western adventurers, and commits a portion of sales proceeds to conservation-minded nonprofits.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying). GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].
Bottom Line
A very pretty washed Ethiopia Geisha with complex citrus and spice-toned florals, and a compelling umami undercurrent.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 14 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2022. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Corvus particularly focuses on processing methods and selective harvesting, which results in small, seasonal micro-lots of uniquely sweet, vibrant, and clean flavor profiles. For more information, visit www.corvuscoffee.com.

A decadent fruit-centered medley of stone fruit, tropical fruit, citrus and crisp cocoa nib with exceptionally vibrant acidity and mouthfeel.

Produced at Daterra Estate entirely from coffee of the Aramosa pre-cultivar, a cross between the Coffea arabica species and the small-beaned Coffea racemosa species from South Africa. This crossbreeding was aimed at combining Racemosa’s low caffeine and drought-resistance with Arabica’s flavor. (Aramosa is a pre-cultivar still under development and study.) Processed by the anaerobic honey method (coffee fruit with skins removed but mucilage intact is subject to reduced oxygen ferment before drying). Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

A coffee from the just-developed Amarosa pre-cultivar processed by the anaerobic honey method — worth seeking out both for its rarity and its striking cup profile.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 10 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2023. Produced by Diego Bermudez, from trees of the original Panama T.2722 cultivar of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobic washed method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over oxidation or continued fermentation. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

A decadent, expressive, voluptuous double-anaerobic Colombia Geisha with a wide range of aromas and flavors, from spice-toned bergamot to super-sweet lychee.

Poised, balanced, quietly complete. Cocoa nib, green grape, freesia-like flowers, roasted almond, brown sugar in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweet-toned structure with vivacious acidity; lively, satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish focuses around notes of green grape and freesia with almond undertones.
Notes
This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
Bottom Line
A deep-toned Kenya cup that prioritizes depth over fireworks — solid cocoa, nut and sweet fruit notes predominate in this engaging and accessible coffee.

Roasty-sweet, floral-toned. Honeysuckle, date, scorched birch, dark chocolate, Meyer lemon zest in aroma and cup. Crisp, juicy acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. Chocolaty finish with undertones of lemon and honeysuckle.
Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans, and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying). GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan, that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].
Bottom Line
A surprisingly bright dark-roasted Ethiopia Gesha with a throughline of pretty florals and rich chocolate notes.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Pro Aroma Enterprise Coffee Co., Ltd. is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee company. For more information, visit proaroma.weebly.com or email [email protected].
Bottom Line
A fusion of fruit (blueberry) and savory (fine musk) drive the cup, punctuated by citrusy brightness.

Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of La Macarena Farm, entirely of the Yellow Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by a complexly detailed version of the double-anaerobic method (sealed-tank fermentation of the whole fruit with the addition of brewer’s yeast, removal of skin and pulp, and a second fermentation of the beans shut in the tank with the removed skin and pulp). Additional processing nuance includes a thermal shock wash (soaking the whole fruit in hot water for 30 seconds, then cold water for 30 seconds) to reduce astringency. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.
Bottom Line
This intense fruit and floral bomb, tempered only by aromatic wood notes, is interesting for its experimental processing, and offers clear appeal for devotees of fruity, floral coffees.

Notes
Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean.

This version was grown in Kona and processed by the anaerobic natural fermentation method. Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years. In 2017 they introduced several distinguished new tree varieties to their 4.7 acre farm, including this one, which they are offering for the first time. Visit konafarmdirect.com for more information.

Intense, eccentric anaerobic candy-bomb. Very sweet, intensely fruity and spicy. Bubblegum, musk, raspberry, pistachio, ginger in aroma and cup. Profoundly sweet in structure with a touch of delicately tart acidity. Velvety, lively mouthfeel. In the finish candyish notes fade and musky flowers come forward.
Notes
Produced by Sebastián Ramirez of Finca El Placer entirely of the Caturra variety of Arabica, and processed by a proprietary anaerobic method, in which 95% ripe and 5% semi-ripe cherries undergo two phases of fermentation. First, the coffee is fermented in the whole cherry in sealed 200-liter tanks for 120 hours at 18 degrees Celsius, with microorganisms present. Then, skins and pulp are removed, leaving some of the fruit flesh on the beans, which are fermented anaerobically for 72 hours with the addition of CO2. The coffee is then slow-dried for 15 days. Chromatic Coffee prides itself in doing everything in-house and meticulously, from printing its attractive bags to modifying equipment to sourcing and roasting its fine coffees. Visit www.chromaticcoffee.com for more information.

A candy-like sweetness is complicated by a lavish, unpredictable display of eccentric aromatic notes, from bubblegum to ginger to musk.

Gently fruit-toned, lyrically sweet. Nectarine, cherry blossom, almond butter, oregano, honey in aroma and cup. Richly sweet with high-toned acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Integrated finish that retains all the notes from the aroma and cup.
Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Taster’s Coffee is a nano-roaster based in new Taipei City, Taiwan. Visit www.tasterscoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A harmonious, fruit- and floral-toned natural-processed Ethiopia Gesha redolent of stone fruit and its flowers.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions.

Notes
This coffee earned the fifth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by Black-owned coffee companies for Coffee Review’s August 2020 report. Coffee trees were brought to Haiti in 1715 when the country was colonized by the French. Farmed by enslaved people, most crops were destroyed in the Haitian revolution of 1791. Efforts to revitalize the coffee industry in Haiti continue in the face of a series of natural disasters and ongoing deforestation. Dávila Kafe was founded by David and Gaïna Dávila to highlight coffees from the underrepresented origins of Haiti and Nicaragua. Visit www.davilakafe.com for more information.

A gentle, sweetly nut-toned coffee from the underrepresented origin of Haiti. Quietly lovely.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying). Bargain Cafe is a specialty coffee roaster in Taitung, Taiwan. Visit https://shopee.tw/iamjiter for more information.

Notes
The Yirgacheffe region produces distinctive coffees from traditional landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the area. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Cimarron Coffee Roasters is a micro-roaster on the Western Slope of Colorado that aims to offer sweet, clean, affordable and sustainable coffee. Roast profiles are developed for each coffee to highlight the inherently distinctive properties of each lot. Shipping is included in the coffee price. Visit www.cimarronroasters.com for more information.

A quietly pleasing dry-processed Yirgacheffe cup with leading notes of citrus supported by sweet almond undertones.

Bright, sweetly tart structure with juicy acidity; silky-smooth, lilting mouthfeel. The resonant finish is saturated with flavor notes from aroma and cup in harmonious balance.
Notes
Certified organic and fair trade. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Souvenir Coffee, based in Berkeley, California goes by the motto, “People first, then coffee.” Visit www.souvenir-coffee.com for more information.

An exceptionally clean, balanced natural-processed Ethiopia cup: integrated berry and citrus notes out front with cocoa undertones and a hint of sweet herb.

Produced by Jamison Savage of Finca Debra entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by an experimental method described as “cascara-infused washed carbonic maceration,” in which the coffee fruit is first pulped, leaving some flesh on the seed, then fermented in CO2-infused tanks along with cascara (the skin and pulp of the coffee fruit). Theory Coffee Roasters is a specialty roaster and coffee shop based in Redding, California. Visit www.theorycoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A complex, multi-layered experimentally processed Geisha cup with focused fruit supported by crisp cocoa notes.

Big, round, very sweet anaerobic, intensely floral. Lilac, lavender, strawberry yogurt, roasted macadamia, a hint of musk in aroma and cup. Candy-like sweetness dominates in the structure, balanced by lactic tang and a savory bottom. Buoyantly syrupy mouthfeel. Complex flowers and nut notes dominate in a continuing sweet but savory-edged finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of Finca El Paraíso entirely of the rare Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by a complexly detailed version of the double-anaerobic method (sealed-tank fermentation of the whole fruit with the addition of brewer’s yeast, removal of skin and pulp, and a second fermentation of the beans shut in the tank with the removed skin and pulp). Additional processing nuance includes a thermal shock wash (soaking the whole fruit in hot water for 30 seconds, then cold water for 30 seconds) to reduce astringency.

Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Jaunt Coffee Roasters is a San Diego-based roaster and café with an extensive coffee and food menu. Visit www.jauntcoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A sweet-toned, fruit-forward natural-processed Ethiopia cup with delicate florals and perfumy resin notes throughout.

Fruit-toned, gently fermenty. Dried apricot, wine barrel, dark chocolate, brown sugar, gardenia in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with winy acidity; crisp, syrupy mouthfeel. Chocolaty finish with notes of sweet wine-like ferment.

A gently winy El Salvador cup, fruit-forward yet crisp and chocolaty.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2023. Produced by Wilton Benitez of Granja Paraiso 92, entirely of the Sidra variety of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobic thermal shock method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.
Bottom Line
An intensely aromatic, richly floral, complexly fruit-driven Colombia Sidra processed by a proprietary double-anaerobic thermal shock method.

Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of Granja Paraiso 92, entirely of the Red Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by the thermal shock method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation. Big Shoulders Coffee is a Chicago artisan roaster that emphasizes a fresh-roasted, no-nonsense approach to fine coffee. Visit www.bigshoulderscoffee.com or call 312-846-1439 for more information.

An enigmatic, multi-layered, tart-leaning Colombia Red Bourbon with impressively complex aromatics.

Richly sweet, deeply aromatic, vibrant. Dried apricot, dark chocolate, narcissus, pink grapefruit zest, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with lively, balanced acidity; full, creamy mouthfeel. A quiet finish centers around chocolate and apricot notes supported by sandalwood.
Notes
This coffee comes from four growing regions in Yemen: Hajja, Haraz, Beni Ismael and Beni Matar. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures. Baba Java is a specialty roaster and cafe retailer located in Hoover Alabama that strives to provide the best coffee experience at every step. Visit www.babajavacoffee.com or call 205-777-5984 for more information.
Bottom Line
A lovely introduction to the pleasures of Yemen: fruit-toned yet balanced, floral yet restrained, and mysterious with its throughline of deep aromatic wood that is more perfumy than earthy.

Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona.

Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Buon Caffe is a specialty coffee roaster and cafe in Taipei, Taiwan. Visit www.buoncaffe.com.tw for more information.

A sophisticated, nuanced natural-processed Ethiopia Gesha centered around notes of dried stonefruit, cocoa nib and sweet herbs.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Drink Coffee Do Stuff operates a roastery in Truckee, California and a coffee shop in nearby Incline Village, Nevada. Visit www.drinkcoffeedostuff.com for more information.

Notes
Produced by Jairo Arcila and Cofinet of Finca Santa Monica entirely of the Castillo variety of Arabica, and processed by an experimental fruit maceration process in which the whole fruit is first fermented in an anaerobic (limited oxygen) environment with wine yeasts and macerated fruit. After fermentation, the coffee cherries are pulped and placed to dry on raised beds with macerated fruits until the ideal moisture content is achieved. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.
Bottom Line
While the co-fermentation with strawberries is not obvious in the cup, there’s an overt berry throughline here that isn’t afraid to take over — an invocation of summer desserts.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying). Kafe Coffee Roastery is a specialty roaster based in Zhubei, Taiwan.

A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Black cherry, cocoa nib, lilac, toffee, sassafras. Sweet-savory structure with juicy acidity; crisp, delicate mouthfeel. The savory-sweet theme continues into the finish with notes of lilac and sassafras. The volume is turned down in milk in exchange for a mellow, toffee-driven vibe.
Notes
The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Dripdash brewed and canned the coffee. The brewing was conducted using a cold brewing method in which ice-chilled water drips through a bed of ground coffee over the course of several hours per batch. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The coffee, sourced and roasted by Chromatic, is a blend of a natural-processed Brazil, a washed Ethiopia, and a washed Guatemala. Chromatic prides itself in doing everything in-house and meticulously, from printing its attractive bags to modifying equipment to sourcing and roasting its exceptional coffees. Visit www.chromaticcoffee.com for more information.

This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Cafe Virtuoso is a small-batch coffee roaster that is ethically invested in procuring, roasting and delivering the highest quality and best-tasting organic coffee in San Diego. Visit www.cafevirtuoso.com or call 619-550-1830 for more information.
Bottom Line
A complex, multi-layered natural-processed Ethiopia cup, cleanly fruit-forward and crisply chocolaty.

Tropical fruit-toned. Mango, orange zest, dark chocolate, marjoram, oak in aroma and cup. Very sweet structure with brisk acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. Chocolaty, fruity finish.
Notes
Produced by Diego Bermudez of Finca al Paraiso, from trees of the Castillo, Colombia and Caturra varieties of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobi washed method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). VERYTIME is a specialty nano-roaster based in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Visit www.verytime.com.tw/ for more information.

Produced by Samuel Zevala Gonzalez entirely of the big-beaned Maracaturra variety of Arabica and processed by the honey method, in which some fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. Dávila Kafe was founded by David and Gaïna Dávila to highlight coffees from the underrepresented origins of Haiti and Nicaragua. Visit www.davilakafe.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A big, confident Maracaturra cup from Nicaragua with nuanced savory notes underpinning richly sweet fruit and herb leanings.

Grown near Neji in the Sidama/Sidamo growing region, this is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. BEI Coffee Roasters is a Hong Kong-based specialty roaster focused on microlots and multiple roasting methods for the same coffee. Visit www.facebook.com/bei.coffeekan.
Bottom Line
A beautifully structured, harmoniously integrated natural-processed Ethiopia cup — elegantly bright, fruity, floral, chocolaty.

Gently sweet-tart, complexly layered. Dried blackberry, honeysuckle, hazelnut butter, cocoa nib, a hint of wine barrel in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with winey acidity; full, syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to notes of hazelnut butter and cocoa nib with undertones of blackberry.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with washed coffees. Merge is a specialty coffee roaster in Harrisonburg, Virginia dedicated to ethical sourcing of high-quality coffees. Visit www.mergecoffeeco.com for more information.
Bottom Line
A fruit-forward, natural-processed Guji cup with a hint of sweet ferment and deep nut and cocoa undertones.

Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica. Processed by the kōji method, in which the coffee fruit is first sterilized and then fermented in a bio-reactor and inoculated with a selection of Japanese kōji (Aspergillus oryzae). This mold species breaks down starch into simple sugars and is commonly used in the production of soy sauce, miso, sake and shōchū. After whole-fruit fermentation, the coffee is pulped and subjected to a second fermentation phase. A bean-sealing process follows, carried out through impacts of hot and cold water, before the beans are dried by machine for 46 hours. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.
Bottom Line
Balanced, deep, elegant and inviting, this experimentally processed Geisha is characterized by tropical fruit, bittersweet citrus, and rich aromatic wood notes.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Rich-toned, bright, chocolaty. Tamarind, pink grapefruit zest, dark chocolate, hazelnut butter, fresh-cut cedar in aroma and small cup. Syrupy-smooth mouthfeel; richly bittersweet finish with notes of dark chocolate and pink grapefruit zest. In three parts milk, nut and dark chocolate notes pleasingly dominate.
Notes
Processed by the yellow honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the yellow honey variation, a thin layer of pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, more than with white honey, but less than is the case with red or black honey. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
Bottom Line
A single-origin coffee from Costa Rica processed by the yellow honey method and roasted for espresso: high-toned, richly bittersweet, especially complex in the milk shot.

Notes
Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from indigenous varieties of landrace Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is rounder and lower-toned than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

A clean, juicy, bright natural Ethiopia cup with pretty tropical fruit notes balanced by deep nut and floral tones.

Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of Granja Paraiso 92, entirely of the Caturra variety of Arabica, and processed by the thermal shock method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation. Big Shoulders Coffee is a Chicago artisan roaster that emphasizes a fresh-roasted, no-nonsense approach to fine coffee. Visit www.bigshoulderscoffee.com or call 312-846-1439 for more information.

A medley of both tropical and candy-like fruit impulses characterizes this juicy Colombia Caturra processed by an innovative “thermal shock” method.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

Crisply savory, very sweet. Hazelnut, rhododendron, fig, dried raspberry, salted caramel in aroma and cup. In taste structure displays a startling but pleasing juxtaposition of intense sweetness and deep umami. Lightly satiny in mouthfeel. Smooth, resonant in the finish – fig, vanilla.
Notes
Produced by Marta Bayter and her sons, Shady and Elias, of Vergel Estate, entirely of the Caturra variety of Arabica, and processed by the anaerobic honey method with the addition of red fruits to the fermentation step. Prism Coffee Works is a specialty roaster, cafe and barista training center based in Seoul, South Korea. Visit www.instagram.com/prismcoffeeworks for more information.
Bottom Line
Equal parts sweet and umami impulses drive this anaerobic honey Colombia. Co-ferment with red fruits promotes a floral, berry-toned, salty caramelly profile.

Processed by the red honey method, meaning that some fruit flesh or “honey” was allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
Bottom Line
A cleanly fruit-forward Costa Rica coffee roasted for espresso, with notes of dried stone fruit, dark chocolate, and spice-toned florals.

Blind Assessment
High-toned, fruit-driven. Mulberry, cocoa nib, tangerine zest, pink peppercorn, agave syrup in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with juicy-bright acidity; viscous, velvety mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to notes of mulberry and tangerine zest with undertones of pink peppercorn.
Notes
Guji is nestled next to the better-known Yirgacheffe and Sidamo growing regions; it shares their devotion to the distinctive, largely indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in these regions. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version (dried in the whole fruit).

Bottom Line
A uniquely composed cup — think mulberry and pink peppercorn — with a crisp cocoa throughline.

Richly chocolaty, deeply sweet. Dark chocolate, freesia-like flowers, crisp pear, vanilla bean, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet in structure with gentle acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. Quiet, chocolaty finish with notes of pear and cedar.

This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of washed-process coffees from Central America and Mexico for Coffee Review’s September 2020 report.

Evaluated as espresso. Rich-toned, deeply chocolaty. Dark chocolate, raspberry, molasses, hazelnut, fresh-cut oak in aroma and small cup. Very syrupy mouthfeel; chocolaty, nut-toned finish. In three parts milk, a pretty floral note suggesting gardenia surfaces alongside raspberry and chocolate.
